I would suggest you to go to YouTube and search for “Robert Feranec”. He is a pioneer in this field and he has put a lot of videos on how to get started with PCB Design. He uses a software called “Altium Designer” which is one of the standard software used in the industry.

Now the catch is the software isn’t free. But, if you have an academic account, you can download it for free.

If you don't have a student account and you cant afford to buy the software(it is a bit pricey though), the same company provides another free PCB Design software called “Altium Circuit Maker”. That is completely free and has a very similar design interface to the “Altium Designer Software”(first paragraph - paid version)

Now that we are done with the software, you can start learning from the above mentioned channel. In addition, Altium themselves have a YouTube channel named “Altium Academy”. You can check that out as well.

Happy Learning and Designing! :D
